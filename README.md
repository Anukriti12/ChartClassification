# ChartClassification

Problem statement: To develop a CNN-based classification architecture for classifying a given chart image to one of five chart classes, namely “Line”,“Dot Line”,“Horizontal Bar”, and “Vertical Bar”, and “Pie” chart.

Task 1: Download the given (charts folder). Use the train and Val images for training and validation in an appropriate ratio (e.g., 80% for training and 20 % for validating). The CSV file contains corresponding labels for the images.

Task 2: Implement a two-layer Convolutional Neural Network, and calculate accuracy, loss and plot the obtained loss. Briefly write your observation and submit your code so that we can evaluate your implementation at our end.

Task 3: Finetune a pretrained network (e.g., AlexNet) for this task and report the results.

Task 4: Try out something new! (e.g., data augmentation, transformer-based approach, detection-type approach, GradCam, ablations, or anything you feel)
